# Logr

This is a monorepo containing the different parts of an API logging app called Logr.

## Why?

I just want to build cool shit, I guess.

## Features

It logs and displays various API metrics. That's pretty much it.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Bun
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js
- **Backend Framework:** Hono
- **Database:** Postgres

I'll also be using Drizzle as the ORM, Biome for linting and formatting, Husky for Git hooks, Lintstaged for running linters on staged files.
