# Deko

Deko is a self-hosted API logging and observability tool. It captures structured API request metadata, performance metrics, and contextual logs in near real time, allowing teams to inspect, filter, and analyze how their APIs behave in production.

Deko is designed to be easy to run and own. It prioritizes fast ingestion, efficient storage, and indexed querying, providing practical API observability without vendor lock-in, invasive instrumentation, or unsafe data capture.

> **Note:** This is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use.
